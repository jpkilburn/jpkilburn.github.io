      <p>I'm a web designer from Florence, Alabama, and I love the web. I've always had an interest in technology and art, and I love blending the two in the field of web design. I am a graduate of the University of North Alabama as of the spring of 2016, and I am eager to get into the field and develop myself further.</p>
      
      <p>Feel free to look at my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> if you'd like to see more of my professional background.</p>
      
      <p>I believe in making sites with a strong focus on accessibility. I always attempt to make my designs with the user's experience in mind, so that my client's message gets to their audience as cleanly as possible.</p>
      
      <p>When I'm not working with code I'm an avid gamer. I also love making digital art, working on creative writing, and playing my violin! I also enjoy keeping up with web developer trends online, peeking around at the new tools and tricks people are talking about.</p>

    <h2>About My Site</h2>
    <p>This site has been created using GitHub Pages for hosting, and by extension Git for version control. I've used Jekyl for templating and blog handling. To keep things light I've used Skeleton CSS for my CSS boilerplate; all the other styling is handmade! Assets from Font Awesome and Google Fonts have also been used.</p>
