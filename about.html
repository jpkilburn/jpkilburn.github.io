  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm a web designer from Florence, Alabama, and I love the web. I've always had an interest in technology and art, and my favorite blend of these two has been designing websites and applications. At the moment I am unemployed and looking to enter the field either under regular employment or with freelance work.</p>
  <p>I believe in making sites with a strong focus on accessibility. I always attempt to make my designs with the user's experience in mind, so that my client's message gets to their audience as cleanly as possible.</p>
  <p><small>When I'm not sifting through code I enjoy gaming, digital art, creative writing, and making music with my violin.</small></p>
