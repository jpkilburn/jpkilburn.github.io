          As part of my employment for the University of North Alabama's communications 
          department I created a Social Media Directory app that could be used to manage 
          the University's many accounts. Though the university manager is able to view 
          all accounts registered onto the directory, only those that are verified as 
          official and active pages are displayed to the public.

          Developed as a project for my Computer Information Systems capstone class at 
          the University of North Alabama, this site was my first experience working 
          directly with a client, and bringing a website from nothing to a full launch. 
          As the lead developer on the project I created the site's layout, developed 
          the PHP forms, and assisted with formatting most pages.
