          As part of my employment for the University of North Alabama's communications 
          department I created a Social Media Directory app that is used to manage the 
          various accounts relevant to UNA. With this app the university webmaster is able
          to view the full list of accounts and manage their information, while the public facing
          portion displays only verified and active accounts to visitors.

          the University of North Alabama, this site was taken from concept to full deployment 
          during my senior year. As lead developer for my team I created the site's layout, developed 
          it's submittable forms, formatted most pages and added embeds for external content.

          My first experience with designing and deploying a complete site, the Shoals Symphony 
          site was deployed with a fully responsive design and makes use of PHP for templating pages 
          and submitting forms for the symphony's organizers.
