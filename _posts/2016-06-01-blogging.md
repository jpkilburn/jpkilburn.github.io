I've finished the styling on most of the site, and now just need to focus on making the blog presentable. Right now I've begun editing the post pages, but the blog index is still very bare bones (just a simple unordered list at the time of writing). As I finish up work on this site I'm going to be using it to post updates while I learn some new tools, so I'm hoping to keep it somewhat active.

I'm likely going to wipe these original posts or at least rewrite them before I get to posting actual content. While these have so far been simple text I'm going to look into adding a little bit more to them (at the least an image to display to the home page). For now these are mainly to add some content to this space and allow me to see how these posts are being formatted with my current CSS.
