As of today I'm going to consider the main site more or less finished; while it's my personal site and will likely see a few edits here and there, it's currently in pretty good shape and I'm content to leave it be while I work on some other things now. As I mentioned lightly in my last post, those other things are going to be other technologies; primarily aimed at web development, though I may dip back into some other programming if the time is available.

Here's a list of what I'm thinking of working on:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a>: While I love Bootstrap, I've read some articles regarding frameworks and I can understand why having the full package that Bootstrap provides could be a little too weighty, unnecessarily so for most projects.</li>
  <li><a href="https://magento.com/">Magento</a>: I was recommended this a while back, and I'd still like to dig into it. I'm honestly not entirely sure what to expect in terms of how this is used, so I'm very interested in getting some hands on experience with the free community edition they provide.</li>
  <li><a href="http://mean.io/">MEAN Stack Development</a>: I already have some experience with MEAN, but it's definitely not comparable to my understanding of PHP. I've dabbled enough into it to realize it's a pretty powerful platform though, and I'm eager to get past the simple CRUD applications I've currently built in it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a>: This one is lower on the list, but it's a language I've definitely been interested in since I heard about it.</li>
</ul>


That's in no particular order, of course, and I'll be adding to it as I go. I believe each of them will be a decent addition to both my personal skills as a developed, and a fair addition to my resume. On top of these I'll also be creating a <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/175/">CSS garden</a>, since I enjoy making themes and templates. They likely won't get as elaborate as the CSS Zen Garden examples I've linked, but I may try some more ambitious designs as I progress.
