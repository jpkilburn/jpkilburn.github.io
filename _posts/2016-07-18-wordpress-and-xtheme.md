I've had some light usage of Wordpress before, and though I'll acknowledge it has a lot of value on the client's side, I personally didn't enjoy my initial work with it. I generally find visual editors to be a bit clumsy when compared to writing out code by hand, and the code they produce tends to be a little difficult to parse. Ultimately writing by hand is just cleaner and more convenient, at least in my experience. Unfortunately, what's convenient for the designer isn't always going to be good for the user the site is being made for. While I could create a site out of HTML like I've done with this portfolio site and update it quickly, that takes skill that a client either may not have, or may not be comfortable attempting to learn and use.<!--more-->

Wordpress is an excellent solution for giving clients control of a site. It runs off of a set of templates styled into a theme and manages pages through a back-end editor. The user gets control of several different components and how they're displayed, and adding utilities such as a blog or a calendar are relatively simple. Unfortunately, styling and customizing these pages can be somewhat limited; customization is sacrificed for ease of access.

An interesting solution to this can be found with the X Theme, a custom theme by Themeco that offers a trio of different customizable layouts and a robust visual editor through Cornerstone. While this doesn't provide full control to the developer, it does allow the final product to look far less static and more sleek and modern than the templated pages Wordpress will typically produce. What can't be modified through Wordpress or Cornerstone's editor can be done through the sitewide CSS. This allows the end product to be far more diverse than the typical Wordpress-powered site, with an editor that is far more powerful for the client to access and utilize.

Unfortunately the most I can provide for a demonstration of my work through these tools is through screenshots, which don't serve as a good example due to the animated nature of many of Cornerstone's features. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/0WQ3l">Here are a few screenshots</a> of the test site regardless.

While I wouldn't be inclined to use this on smaller or static pages, Wordpress and XTheme are a very accessible and affordable option when it comes to giving editing power to the client.
