Last week I began a redesign on my site, tossing out the Bootstrap-built code and starting from scratch with Skeleton. I also tried to take an approach that would highlight it more as a freelancer's page, rather than the portfolio site it had been in the past. It's a fresh coat of paint on the site as I begin looking into jobs online with Upwork and other services, and I think it will do a better job at showcasing my work.<!--more-->

<h4>Bootstrap to Skeleton</h4>
As I mentioned in the previous posts I had made on this blog, the more I looked at the different services offered between the two I found myself realizing that Bootstrap wasn't really necessary for a site like this. It was far more feature-rich than anything I would ever need, and that was an extra load on my site that I could take off without any problems. The few bits and pieces of Bootstrap that I did use were easily replaced by some snippets of styling or scripting, mainly for the mobile navbar.

Additionally, as a designer I felt there was a bit of an additional incentive to create my own classes and pull less from Bootstrap's stylings. Using external CSS isn't actually a problem, of course, but I considered it a chance to refresh myself on my CSS skills while I worked. The new stylesheet attempts to reuse and condense on classes, and ultimately be much more flexible than my previous design.

<h4>The New Look</h4>
Speaking of the site's design, the new revision has a very different look to it compared to the previous one (which you can see <a href="https://jpkilburn.github.io/design-gallery/jpkilburnold.html">here</a>). As I work my way towards work as a designer I think it's important to have a bit more personality in my portfolio. The previous iteration used mainly grayscale tones, and the impact image on the index was a simple stock image. I wouldn't call the original design for this site <em>bad</em>, but I do think it was a little lacking for a designer's page.

By contrast I believe the new look for the site is much more striking. Bolder and less muted, with blue tones to draw the eyes towards links and other important pieces of text. I also took some time to create a graphic of my own for the index page. I also have plans to make far better use of Jekyll's blogging systems, which I'll cover at the end of this post. Overall I think the new design has a lot more potential, and looks a lot 'fresher' with it's contrasting colors.

<h4>Additions and Subtractions</h4>
Style and layout isn't the only thing that's been changed on the site. The navbar has been edited, and there are some new features on the site. Instead of simply listing my email on my about page, a <a href="https://jpkilburn.github.io/contact">contact</a> page now supplies both the address and a form to reach me through. My resume page has been pulled off of the navbar and placed in the portfolio page, since as a designer the work I've done will likely be of more interest to employers. Also new on the portfolio page is a <a href="https://jpkilburn.github.io/design-gallery.html">design gallery</a>, where I'll be hosting some sample designs I've created as a supplement to my portfolio.

The major removal from the site will be my more personal contact information (having my address and phone number listed online was probably not a necessity), as well as my previous blog posts. While I believe their content was serviceable as a simple portfolio site, I'll be trying to make better posts to this blog in the future, with a new category system and more uses of graphics for my development projects.

<h4>Loose Ends</h4>
Naturally there are a few things still left to work on. I'd like to grow my design gallery further, which I'll do both with older projects and by making new test designs, and I'd like to start pursuing some more self-directed learning on Ruby and some other frameworks soon as well. I'm also planning on converting my portfolio into an automatically generated page, much like my blog index, and supply visitors with a better look at my previous work with both images and a better written description for them.

I look forward to developing this site further, hopefully with some freelance work in the future!
