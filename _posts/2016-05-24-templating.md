Jekyll has been a great addition to the site and I'm liking the new style of templating, but it seems that I'm going to need to fine-tune some things for it to work on a mobile screen. At the moment everything looks a bit too small on my iPod, and it looks as if the navigation bar isn't collapsing appropriately- so, that's my current task. I've also been working on making the homepage more presentable, including the addition of a new responsive banner and a better display for these updates I'm writing. At the moment only the homepage is handling them well, though; I'll need to work on the blog and individual post pages, since at the moment they're fairly bare-bones.

In the future I'm likely going to want to change these front-page updates to be snippets of posts rather than full content displays, since I'm likely going to be adding more length and images as I transition from designing this personal site to maintaining it as a blog.
