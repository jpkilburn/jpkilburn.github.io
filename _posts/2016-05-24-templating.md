Jekyll has been a great addition to the site and I enjoy the new style of templating, but it's inclusion does appear to have made some issues for my original design. I'm now going through and fine-tuning my templates to make sure everything remains mobile responsive, and that all of my resources such as my image and CSS folders are being properly accessed.<!--more-->


I've also been working on making the homepage more presentable. While I'm not personally a fan of the large <a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/web-design/exploring-hero-image-trend-web-design/">hero banner</a> design many sites use, I do enjoy a prominent title banner to grab the attention of the viewer. I've grabbed a stock image from <a href="https://stocksnap.io/">StockSnap</a> to accomplish that, and I think it fits the more muted color scheme I'm using on this site pretty well.


I'll still be going through and adjusting the post layouts, since at the moment they're fairly bare-bones. In the future the hope is to change the current front-page feed into small snippets of posts, rather than a full content display or a simple title. Thankfully there's some easy ways to implement this in Jekyll, so I'll just need to restructure them a little with an <strong>excerpt_separator</strong> to add that functionality in.
