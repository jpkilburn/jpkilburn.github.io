I've added <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to my site, and with it restructured pretty much everything! While I had looked into Jekyll before starting this project I had assumed it was a small add-on for blogging alone; as it turns out, it's a complete templating engine for developing static pages. This allows me to drastically cut down on the contents of each individual file, and while I don't necessarily <em>need</em> that, it does leave things looking quite clean and quick to recognize at a glance.<!--more-->

As a result of adding Jekyll my site's directory now looks like this:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/imgs/siteFolder.png" alt="site directory" class="img-responsive center">

My root folder is filled with the main pages of my site, with the posts being seperated out into the <strong>_posts</strong> folder and my repeating content (such as the header and footer) is placed in the <strong>_includes</strong> folder. The <strong>_layouts</strong> string everything together, assembling pages in a template that is called upon my the pages in a special header handled by Jekyll.

Now that I have posts and templates working I'll need to find a better way to display them.
