I've added <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to my site, and with it restructured pretty much everything! While it's added a few new items to my site directory, it's actually seems pretty lightweight. With it added my site is now using a more efficient templating format, and allows me to plug in blog posts pretty easily.

Next I'm going to work on displaying these posts to my homepage in a better way.
