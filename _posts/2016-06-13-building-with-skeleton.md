It's been a bit longer than I expected before finishing up with Skeleton, but I ended up becoming a little sidetracked with it; mainly with developing themes and different page templates in it. I actually really enjoy Skeleton, and I think it makes a wonderful alternative to Bootstrap. The features it lacks have so far been easily added back in, and it generally just looks cleaner than Bootstrap when writing it.<!--more-->


While I'm not going to be able to display my work in full for all of these technologies I'm hoping to cover, I am able to do so with Skeleton. You can view the page I created <a href="http://jpkilburn.github.io/skeleton" target="blank">here</a>. The page has only a small snippet of JavaScript, and calls upon a single CSS file (outside of FontAwesome's inclusion)-- that CSS file being one generated from a personal .scss file, as well as the skeleton.css and normalize.css combined via Sass. While the page is simple, I think it conveys the functionality well enough. I could have added some responsive tables and a few other features in (Skeleton actually comes prepackaged with responsive table classes), but I believe the navigation bar and the responsive and altered images serve the purpose well enough.


In the future I may go back and rewrite this site with Skeleton, since these pages don't use Bootstrap heavily enough to justify it's inclusion. While I'd love to go start on that now, I'd prefer to keep going and adding a few more technologies to this blog before starting on a revision.


Next I plan to either start looking into Magento, or continue developing with MEAN Stack programming.
