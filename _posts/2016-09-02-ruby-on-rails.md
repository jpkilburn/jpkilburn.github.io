Over the last few weeks I have been looking into <b>Ruby on Rails</b>, and by extension some of Ruby. Ruby on Rails is a server-side framework, like NodeJS. While I have been doing less work with the back-end of web development, I still think it is important to cultivate some skill with both halves of a site. Though I will be doing some more practice with Rails, so far I've found this framework pretty enjoyable!<!--more-->

My points of comparison with Rails are mainly with NodeJS and PHP, the other server-side tools I've used so far. Since PHP isn't exactly comparable to the two toolkits, I've narrowed that further to just Node. Back-end development has always been a bit of a less covered area for me, but I believe as I continue working with it I'm growing to understand it better. I definitely believe Rails has been a bit more accessible so far, and with some tutorials I've been using to assist my learning of it I'd hesitantly say I have a bit of a better grasp on it than Node.

Unfortunately much like with Wordpress I can't readily host examples of my work here, since I would need a host of my own. Once I finish my current project I will make another post including some screenshots and snippets, however. So far my dabbling has mostly been confined to tooling around with CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functions on a few different models. The initial project was a (tutorial assisted) blog, composed of posts that could have comments added to them, complete with some simple authentication. My self-directed project is going to be a simple social media site.

After I finish this I believe I will take a short break from back-end development and work on a CSS garden, as mentioned in my previous posts. There should be some more updates on this soon!
